## Description
This project consists of multiple Python scripts organized into three main directories: `question_one`, `question_two`, and `question_three`. Each directory contains files that address different tasks or questions.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the required libraries installed before running any scripts. To install the necessary packages from requirements.txt



## Scripts Overview

### Question One
`question_one.py` includes functionality related to:
- File operations (`shutil`)
- Data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Regular expressions (`re`)
- Sending emails (`smtplib`, `email.mime`)
- Database operations (`sqlite3`)
- HTTP requests (`requests`)
- Compression (`gzip`)
- OS operations (`os`)
- Date and time operations (`datetime`)
- Logging (`logging`)
- Multithreading (`concurrent.futures`, `threading`)
- Caching (`functools.lru_cache`)
- Error handling (`traceback`)

You can update any configuration using the `bconfig.py` file in the `question_one` folder.

### Question Two
`question_two.py` includes functionality related to:
- HTTP requests (`requests`)
- Data manipulation (`pandas`)
- HTML parsing (`bs4`)

### Question Three
`question_three.py` includes functionality related to:
- File compression (`zipfile`)
- Data manipulation (`pandas`)
- OS operations (`os`)
- Date and time operations (`datetime`)
- Logging (`logging`)
- Error handling (`traceback`)

## Usage
To run the scripts, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the Python script. For example:

cd question_one
python3 question_one.py

Repeat the process for `question_two` and `question_three` as needed.
